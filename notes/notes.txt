## UDP features
* It has a short header that includes the source and destination port numbers, a length field and a checksum
* UDP offers no guarantee of delivery
* Provides a means of transmitting messages of to to 64 kbytes in size

## TCP features
* Provides reliable delivery of arbitrarily long sequences of bytes via stream-based programming abstraction
* is connection oriented
* sequencing
* flow control
* retransmission

### Characteristics of interprocess communication
* to communicate, one process sends a message to a destination and another process at the destination receives the message
* A queue is associated with each message destination
* Sending processes cause messages to be added to remote queues
* receiving processes remove messages from local queues
* Communication between the sending and receiving processes may be either synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous(non-blocking)
* The receive operation can have blocking and non-blocking variants
