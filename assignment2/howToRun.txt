Steps & notes to run program
1). Run javac Chat.java
2). Open up three seperate terminal windows
3). In each window type, "java Chat localhost 4200", for each window it's 4200...4202; "java Chat <id> <port> -> java Chat localhost 4200"
4). In the first window, type "join 4201"
5). In the second window, type "join 4202"
6). In the third window, type "join 4200"
At this point all the servers are connected in a loop.
7). In any terminal window type, "<put port message>" to send a message.
8). Go to terminal two and use "Leave" command.

Remarks: We hit some road-bumps along the way, our code compiles fine, but we had issues, correctly implementing "leave" and "accept". We would actually like to discuss our project with you at this point.
